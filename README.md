## Overview

Application to read account statement files from different peer to peer lending sites,
e.g. Mintos.com and produce a Portfolio Performance readable csv file. Input format needs to be csv!


## Requirements

Python 3 (implemented with python 3.6.4)

## Dependencies

The configuration for this application is stored in yaml files. The module used for
loading yaml files is [ruamel.yaml](https://yaml.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). 
Install via:

`pip install ruamel.yaml`

## Usage

```
parse-account-statements.py --help
usage: parse-account-statements.py [-h] [--type TYPE] [--debug] infile

positional arguments:
  infile       CSV file containing the downloaded data from the P2P site

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  --type TYPE  Specifies the p2p lending operator
  --debug      enables debug level logging if set
```

```
parse-account-statements.py  --type mintos src/test/testdata/mintos.csv
```

## Currently supported formats

### Alternative solution for Auxmoney
Unfortunately, the output file of Auxmoney's reports is not suitable for being parsed by PP-P2P-Parser in a senseful way. As an alternative, you can check out the [PP-Auxmoney-Parser](https://github.com/StegSchreck/PP-Auxmoney-Parser) project.

## Configuration files

Configuration for this script is stored in yaml files located under the config subdirectory. 
The content directly reflects the format of the source account statement files.

Example:

```
---
type_regex: !!map
  deposit: "^Incoming client.*"
  withdraw: "^Withdraw application.*"
  interest: "(^Delayed interest.*)|(^Late payment.*)|(^Interest income.*)|(^Cashback.*)"

csv_fieldnames:
  booking_date: 'Date'
  booking_date_format: '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
  booking_details: 'Details'
  booking_id: 'Transaction ID'
  booking_type: 'Details'
  booking_value: 'Turnover'

```

## Output

CSV file format compatible with Performance Portfolio (German language setting)
